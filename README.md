# VDSR_pytorch
Accurate Image Super-Resolution Using Very Deep Convolutional Networks(VDSR)

Differences from the original paper
- Used default initalizing method of Pytorch
- cropped images 48x48 because of my GPU memory
- 150 epochs
- datasets are consist of only x2 images

PSNR score was worse than SRCNN's
